Weakening affordability, inflation, appraisal bias and mortgage discrimination are eroding Black homeownership gains, according to the National Association of Real Estate Brokers latestState of Housing in Black America report. NAREBs research revealed the Black homeownership rate has declined 8.6 percent over the past two decades, falling from a high of 50 percent to 45.7 percent. As a result, the homeownership rate gap between Black and white Americans has reached its highest point since 1970, two years after the Fair Housing Act was signed into law. Black homeownership is hampered by a mortgage finance system that continues to discriminate, the report read. Black mortgage applicants are turned down more often than Whites; Blacks are more likely to receive high-cost home loans than their White counterparts, and houses in Black neighborhoods are less likely to be appraised at the same values compared to similar homes in white communities. Of the barriers to Black homeownership, mortgage access was highlighted as the most challenging issue. Despite strong workforce participation and a narrowing racial wealth gap, NAREB said Black borrowers still face disproportionate denial rates compared to borrowers of other races. In 2023, Black borrowers applying for conventional loans had a denial rate of 17 percent, triple the denial rate for white borrowers (7 percent). The landscape was the same for Black borrowers applying for non-conventional loans, who also had a denial rate of 17 percent. However, the denial rate gap was slightly smaller for non-conventional loans, with 9 percent of white borrowers being declined. The biggest reasons for mortgage denials among Black borrowers were a high debt-to-income ratio (42 percent) and bad credit history (17 percent). The percentage of denials due to a high debt-to-income ratio decreased as Black borrowers surpassed earnings 120 percent above their area median income (AMI). However, this same group was likelier to face denials due to bad credit history than their white counterparts with similar incomes and creditworthiness. Loan origination failure rates, a comprehensive indicator of unsuccessful loan application outcomes, increased for Black applicants in 2023. Black applicants faced a 38 percent overall failure rate, compared to 25 percent for White applicants, with most of this discrepancy stemming from higher denial rates, the report read. Similar to the previous year, withdrawn applications and closed files due to incomplete information accounted for 21 percent of Black applications and 17 percent of White applications. Black borrowers who successfully qualify for a mortgage, are finding more success with nonbank lenders than traditional banking institutions. The denial rate for Black borrowers with nonbank lenders is 15 percent  34 percent lower than the denial rate at traditional banks (23 percent). Mid-to-high-income Black borrowers are mostly likely to utilize nonbank lenders for their mortgage needs, as very-low to low-income Black borrowers still lean on traditional banking institutions due to Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) regulations.  the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) mandates banks to meet the credit needs of lower-income and underserved communities, the report read. Applications to banks, savings institutions, and credit unions from both racial groups were more common among the very low-income and very high-income bracket applicants. The preference for banks among the lowest-income applicants might be tied to banks efforts to comply with CRA requirements and improve their ratings for lending in low-income areas. Beyond disproportionate denial rates, SHIBA said Black homebuyers and homesellers also suffer from appraisal bias. Low-ball valuations of homes in predominantly Black communities complicate the loan process for Black homebuyers, who will need to compensate for the discrepancy with a higher down payment or higher interest rate. Meanwhile, Black homesellers end up losing out on their rightful equity gains  placing their short and long-term financial plans at risk. Using neighborhood-level [Federal Housing Finance Agency Uniform Appraisal Dataset] data, a 2022 report by the Brookings Institution showed that appraisal transactions in majority-Black neighborhoods are 1.9 times more likely to be appraised under the contract price than similar homes in White neighborhoods, the report read. A longitudinal analysis of UAD aggregate statistics performed by Junia Howell and Elizabeth Korver-Glass found that homes in White neighborhoods are valued twice as much as those in minority communities (i.e., neighborhoods with no White residents). The study found that the average appraised property value gap based on race has widened over time, and the pace has accelerated from 2013 to 2021. NAREB said its working to eliminate mortgage and appraisal discrimination and other key homeownership barriers through partnerships with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the National Society of Real Estate Appraisers (NSREA), the Housing Preservation Exchange (HPE), and several other regulatory and legislative organizations dedicated to closing the homeownership gap. The group is also lobbying for student loan forgiveness, a national homeownership tax credit program, the elimination of loan-level price adjusters, and programs to increase diversity in the appraisal industry. As pointed out in numerous previous NAREB reports, the current housing finance system has its roots in the 1934 establishment of the Federal Housing Administration, the report concluded. Since that time, the geographic landscape and demographic composition of the U.S. population has altered greatly. Although the legislators who worked to enact the housing finance system we have today were extremely discriminatory in precluding access for Black households, the genius of their work created the vibrant White middle class that exists today, it added. Those leaders were visionaries; America needs that type of visionary leadership today.

CAMEO CEO Carolina Martinez: The Untapped Power Of Microbusinesses,"Rhett Buttle, Contributor, 
 Rhett Buttle, Contributor
 https://www.forbes.com/sites/rhettbuttle/",Forbes,"As CEO of CAMEO, Carolina Martinez leads a network of more than 400 members in California who support approximately 200,000 micro businesses with assistance and loans.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/rhettbuttle/2024/11/12/cameo-ceo-carolina-martinez-the-untapped-power-of-microbusinesses/,2024-11-12T15:57:27Z," Carolina Martinez, CEO of the CAMEO Network Approximately 99.9% of businesses in the U.S. are small businesses. Of those small businesses, 85% are micro businesses, meaning they are operated by no more than five people and bring in less than $250,000 in revenue a year. These businesses are often started with $50,000 or less in initial capital so they may not have access to traditional commercial loans. Many major banks do not offer business loans under $250,000 so micro businesses rely on microlending for loans and credit. As CEO of the CAMEO Network, Carolina Martinez leads a network of more than 400 members in California who support approximately 200,000 micro businesses with training, business and credit assistance, and loans. Its members include Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs), Small Business Development Centers (SBDCs), Women Business Centers (WBCs), chambers of commerce, and legal service agencies. I recently had the opportunity to speak with Carolina about CAMEO Networks work and the specific needs of micro businesses. Below is our conversation, edited for clarity. Rhett Buttle: Can you share a bit about your background and what led to the launch of CAMEO Network? Carolina Martinez: CAMEO Network was started by four women who were determined to create and enrich business development programs that serve low-income women entrepreneurs and to break down system barriers to entrepreneurship. Those four organizations have evolved into a 400+ network of business support organizations that make up our entrepreneurial ecosystem of coaching organizations that build the pipeline of loan ready small businesses, mission-driven capital providers (mostly CDFIs), connectors to markets and business networks, and our friends who catalyze small business by promoting entrepreneurship/small business friendly policies. CAMEO Network was born from a desire to build a more inclusive financial system. We realized that helping mission-driven lenders who are providing capital to entrepreneurs in underbanked communities was going to be a powerful way to promote economic opportunity and greater financial inclusion. Our founding coincided with creation of a new program within the U.S. Treasury Department, the national Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) Fund, which was established by President Clinton in 1994 through a bipartisan effort. The creation of the CDFI Fund was a recognition that our financial system needed to do better by small businesses in low- and moderate-income communities. I became interested in entrepreneurship as a career path when I lived in my native Colombia, where I found a job opportunity training former guerrilla combatants at a nonprofit. I saw firsthand how entrepreneurship helped these young people re-enter the economy and create opportunity for themselves. When I moved to the U.S., I carried that passion with me and began working in the small business assistance space. Joining CAMEO Network  an organization with such a strong commitment to and track record of support for the smallest of small businesses  was a natural fit for me. Carolina Martinez: When I joined CAMEO Network in 2018, we were small but mighty. Today, we have greatly expanded our staffing, operating budget, and offerings. We currently represent over 400 organizations, agencies, and individuals  including Small Business Development Centers, CDFIs, and more  that support over 200,000 of Californias smallest businesses through access to capital, coaching, and connections. We also support CDFIs nationwide through our National CDFI Academy, a first-of-a-kind training center providing professional training and resources to thousands of CDFI staff members, launched at the 2022 Clinton Global Initiative and through our Shared Services Center which offers backend support to CDFIs with technology, human resources, and financial services. The pandemic was a huge impetus for our growth. We rapidly scaled our work to help our members to meet the emergency needs of underserved small businesses. Throughout the pandemic and its aftermath, we stepped up our advocacy work on behalf of underserved small businesses, advocating for pandemic small business relief funding, protections from predatory lenders, and expanded for the removal of barriers to entrepreneurship, especially for women- and minority-owned businesses. The pandemic also ushered in a historic small business boom, which brought a renewed urgency to our efforts to build a more equitable economy for small businesses. With so many new businesses starting, we doubled down on our work to ensure every entrepreneur has access to the capital, connections, and coaching they need to grow their business  no matter who they are or what zip code they come from. As part of these efforts, CAMEO Network responded to the needs of the industry with our peer learning and innovative approach for professional development and lending infrastructure building. Our programs have impacted hundreds of microlending and small business lending CDFIs across 49 states and US territories. Were also continuing full speed ahead on our advocacy efforts to break down barriers to entrepreneurship. Over the last few years, weve helped enact a number of landmark policies in California, including the nations first lending transparency law to protect small businesses from predatory financing and Californias recent move to legalize street food vendors. Weve also advocated tirelessly to maintain and increase funding for Californias CDFIs and small business assistance groups. This most recent legislative session, we successfully staved off major proposed cuts to Californias Small Business Development Centers (SBDCs), Women Business Centers (WBCs), and other federally funded programs, despite a serious budget deficit. Carolina Martinez: During the Great Recession, banks significantly pulled back on making the small-dollar, sub-$100,000 loans that small businesses depend on. These types of loans just arent very profitable for banks because they cost the same to underwrite as larger loans but yield less interest. In fact, this decline started even earlier. Since 1997, community banks share of loans under $100,000 declined from 82% to 29%. Its important to note that for the very small and underserved businesses that CAMEO Network supports, accessing affordable loans has ALWAYS been a challenge, because of systemic barriers and discrimination. For instance, many immigrants start businesses but do not have credit histories because they are new to the country, so they cant take out loans or lines of credit. In 2023, Black and Latino business owners were about twice as likely as white business owners to be turned down for funding. Community lenders are different because their whole purpose is to serve the businesses that are being left behind by banks. At its core, micro-business financing is about offering a good product and moving past the aspects of our financial system that perpetuate inequity. As part of this work, CDFIs are very intentional about creating inclusive underwriting systems. For example, many CDFIs have a formula for underwriting that places more emphasis on an applicants character compared to their credit score, because CDFIs recognize the inherent ways in which racism and redlining affect credit scores. CDFIs get to know the person behind the business and invest in their dreams. Carolina Martinez: Community lending is here for any small business that cant get a loan at a traditional bank  which unfortunately, is the majority of small businesses in need of micro-loans. Because of discrimination and the racial wealth gap, businesses that often benefit from micro-business financing include many businesses owned by people of color and immigrants. CDFIs have their doors open to every small business owner, no matter what they look like or where theyre from or who they know. With the small business boom still underway, the need for small business lending is huge, to the point where its pushing past the capacity of the community lending system. Three out of four CDFIs saw an increase in demand over the past year, but only 40% reported being able to fully meet the demand. CDFIs are nonprofits and they work on very limited budgets, so they often struggle to scale their lending as quickly as it needs to be scaled. For instance, many have manual underwriting processes. One particularly significant challenge is marketing. Because CDFIs are nonprofits, they are heavily outspent by for-profit online lenders in terms of advertising. This means that any business owner going to Google and searching for a small business loan will most likely be served ads for predatory lenders  the equivalent of payday lenders for small businesses  before they can find out information about CDFIs. In terms of advertising spend and awareness, this is really somewhere where we need parity for CDFIs. We also need a nationwide law, like we have in California, ensuring that small businesses receive full information about how much a loan costs, including the APR and any fees or other costs. Carolina Martinez: With the post-pandemic surge in entrepreneurship still underway and lots of federal money pouring in to support small businesses, scaling community lending  so CDFIs have capacity to meet this demand and get these federal dollars out the door  is a huge part of our strategy. Thats one of the reasons we launched the National CDFI Academy in 2022, which helps CDFIs scale by helping them invest in recruitment and retention, technology, and marketing  so they can compete with fintechs and banks and expand their reach. Since its launch, weve helped over 291 unique organizations from 49 states and 2 territories, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, resulting in 538 unique individual participants trained. Were also a convener. The California Office of the Small Business Advocate partnered with us to manage the 60 partners who are part of Californias State Small Business Credit Initiative project to provide financial technical assistance to our diverse small businesses. We bring them together to share best practices, develop referral relationships and collaborate on ensuring small businesses have access to all the services they need. Policy work is also core to our efforts to expand access to capital. Like I mentioned earlier, we need a nationwide truth-in-lending law ensuring small business owners can fully understand the costs of their loans and be protected from predatory lenders. We are also looking forward to the implementation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureaus data-collection rule, requiring banks to collect demographic data about who they lend to. This will enable us to measure and address patterns of discrimination in our financial system. Carolina Martinez: Our website, cameonetwork.org, is a great resource for business owners looking to find affordable financing or coaching. We have a list of our members, which includes CDFIs, SBDCs, chambers of commerce, and more, both in California and nationally. Carolina Martinez: If we want to create a brighter future for this country, small businesses have to be at the center of it. When small businesses thrive, we all thrive. They create jobs and prosperity, drive innovation, and build stronger communities. We are in the midst of an incredible moment for small business growth, but we cant take our foot off the gas. The public, private, and philanthropic sectors all have a continued role to play in sustaining the small business boom and building a more inclusive small business economy for the long-term.
