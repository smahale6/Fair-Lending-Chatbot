				Predictions			
 Current FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr has spent much of the last decade positioning himself to be Trump’s likely pick for the next boss of the FCC. He’s likely to get his wish; after spending a lot of time crying about TikTok to get on cable TV and kissing AT&T’s and Comcast’s asses, Carr’s widely considered the frontrunner to head the country’s top telecom and media regulator. If you’ve tracked Carr’s policies, it shouldn’t come as a surprise to you that one of his top goals will be to dismantle the FCC’s already shaky consumer protection efforts.  That means the death of net neutrality, the end of the agency’s inquiry into shitty broadband usage caps, the end of broadband consumer privacy, the end of the FCC’s efforts to stop broadband “redlining” (read: racism in fiber deployment), the end of any good faith efforts to help the poor afford broadband, and an end to efforts to stop Comcast from ripping you off with shitty fees.  Carr’s policies are basically AT&T, Verizon, and Comcast’s policies, dressed up as original thought.  Carr is one of these guys who thinks that if you let giant, unpopular telecom behemoths do whatever they want; miracles and innovation start magically sprouting from the sidewalk. You’ve seen repeatedly how that turns out for the public (be they Republican or Democrat): higher prices, slower speeds, shitty customer service, and a variety of annoying problems like privacy abuses.  As a telecom beat reporter of 25 years now, I can say with absolute certainty that anybody claiming Carr has the slightest interest in a competitive broadband market and consumer welfare is lying to you. I’m writing this down now so that nobody acts surprised when this stuff comes to pass.  Consumer Protection Is Now Basically Illegal  Given the Trump Supreme Court and 5th Circuit have already primed the pump on letting companies basically declare all corporate oversight and consumer protection illegal (I’m really not exaggerating); I don’t suspect the initial assault on consumer rights will take up much of Carr’s time. He should have the agency’s consumer protection efforts fairly well lobotomized by next summer. In telecom, I suspect no shortage of time will be spent rewarding Elon Musk with Starlink unearned subsidies where ever possible, even if taxpayer money is better spent on more reliable and affordable options not managed by a conspiratorial bigot.  I also expect Carr will follow through with his plan to impose a big new tax on tech services (read: you) to even further subsidize his friends at AT&T and Comcast (you can read more about that here). I also suspect Carr will find creative ways to undermine the exploding and hugely popular community broadband movement, and he’ll certainly rubber stamp shitty mergers (like the Verizon Frontier deal) resulting in more telecom consolidation and higher prices and worse service for everyone.  It’s after that where things should get truly interesting in terms of FCC policy under Carr. Carr you might recall wrote an entire chapter of Project 2025. There he makes it clear that he’s hoping to leverage whatever authority the FCC has left to harass tech and media companies that try to rein in Trump’s authoritarianism, whether that’s broadcast journalists critical of Trump, or tech companies doing the absolute bare minimum to stop racists and fascists from being hateful assholes on the internet. Carr isn’t quite as unhinged as many “thought leaders” in the Trump delusion extended infotainment universe, so I’m not entirely sure he’ll go along with Trump’s lust for pulling the broadcast licenses of critical media outlets. But Carr has proven to be such a sniveling sycophant, it would be hard to guarantee he’ll show any real backbone here — which is worrying in and of itself. Indeed, a week ago he did say he supported pulling NBC’s license for putting Kamala Harris on Saturday Night Live, even though NBC absolutely followed the “equal time” rule, giving Donald Trump free ad space the next day (and even as, in other contexts, Carr has been critical of rules like the “equal time” rule). Again Carr’s primary, most immediate goal will be in doing whatever AT&T and Comcast want: namely turning the FCC into the consumer protection and policy equivalent of a decorative seasonal gourd. That means making it easier for giant, shitty telecom monopolies to rip you and your family off. Despite all the rhetoric about “Trump populism,” none of what Carr has planned is at all popular. Keep in mind that despite all of Carr’s bootheel licking it’s entirely possible Trump’s team picks somebody even worse as head of the FCC. In which case, all bets are off.  The question for me then becomes (in telecom and elsewhere), will any of the folks who “voted for this” ever tether their coming pain (higher prices, worse service, more privacy and net neutrality violations) to their own choices? Or are Americans so saturated with propaganda, and U.S. journalism so profoundly broken, that the blame for the suffering to come is just endlessly shifted elsewhere.

 Phoo, I can already tell what the legislative agenda of the next democratic cabinet is going to be. “Project Clean-up-after-Trump-shit-all-over-the-floor” “You’re not cleaning up fast enough! Let’s throw more shit on the floor!” – The American Electorate “Why is there so much shit on the floor?” – Also the American Electorate I didn’t expect the joke to be taken in this direction. Now I’m hospitalized from the pain of how true it feels. ..Also I can’t afford the hospital broadband because Comcast raised the price to the networth of jeff bezos. You’re not thinking cynically enough. “Why did the Democrats throw so much shit on the floor?” – half the American Electorate in 2032. Carr has repeatedly proved he has no real idea what his job is supposed to be. He objects to literally any consumer protections anyone even suggests and his dissents are always long, paranoid screed about how anything positive the FCC wants to do is some grand conspiracy by the Biden Administration. I wouldn’t have figured the Annoying Orange could do worse than Pai, but here we are. Few, if any of Trump’s picks know what their job is supposed to be. It doesn’t matter. Because their actual job is to break shit. This is how empires end. Step aside .. stable geniuses at work here .. pick up that can! This is how Pax Americana ends. Carr has repeatedly proved he has no real idea what his job is supposed to be. On the contrary, he knows exactly what his job is and which interests he’s there to serve, it’s just not ‘protect the public from predatory companies’ and ‘the public’s’ respectively. I look forward to the establishment of a brand new federal governmental regulatory agency .. Department of Government Efficiency DOGE or something like that.  I am curious about what they will dodge.  Anyways, this is just what the MAGA ordered, iirc, they wanted to get rid of all government agencies or what they call Deep State, so to that end we will have an additional governmental agency – and that is a win in anyone’s book, yeah? The future may hold some entertainment value, when Elon (DOGE) Musk decides to get rid of the FCC there may be pushback from fellow magas. Get the pop corn.  The fun has already started.  Let the infighting begin. This comment has been flagged by the community. Click here to show it. I think a lot of libs are relieved Trump was reelected because he’s going to do things they secretly wanted but didn’t want to risk social opprobrium for by supporting publicly. So they can still earn social status points from fake disapproval of Trump and get what they want. Win-win. I think you’re trying to delude yourself into thinking that all these totalitarian policies are right and proper because everyone wants them, and that you’re not a bad person for supporting these policies. Let me be clear because the past month has shown me that when talking to Trump voters you need the subtlety of a brick.  These policies are garbage.  Anybody who actually knows what these policies will accomplish does not want them, except for the already rich and powerful.  And you’re a shitty person for supporting them. The amount of ignorance and stupidity in just two sentences here is off the charts. “he’s going to do things they secretly wanted” Yes, I have always wondered if a hurricane could be stopped with a thermal nuclear weapon.  Now that Donald is in charge, we will find out just how stupid this is. In addition, I look forward to our next pandemic and the resulting chaos – better stock up on the toilet paper now. and the food supply chain, omg – what fun The FCC thing will probably suck. But things have to be looked at with a big picture perspective.  The overall Trump impact will make some things worse and some things better. Would you trade higher FCC fees for lower Federal taxes? How about for higher investment returns in the stock market? Any one issue in isolation is difficult to weigh the overall impact it will make on an individual or family without looking at the bigger picture impact that ALL the changes will make. No on that trade. But also prove that such a tradeoff is really a thing. My retirement investment account getting a slight bump won’t matter if I end up spending so much more on tariff-induced inflation and that money is all worth less. Hooking up your parent’s wifi to their community ISP will expose you to the same criminal penalties as performing an abortion. “Carr is one of these guys who thinks that if you let giant, unpopular telecom behemoths do whatever they want; miracles and innovation start magically sprouting from the sidewalk.” Not quite right. Carr is one of these guys who thinks that if you let giant, unpopular telecom behemoths do whatever they want; money and clout will start magically sprouting from the his “toilet” – better known as the Donald. There. Much better. 🙂 “Or are Americans so saturated with propaganda, and U.S. journalism so profoundly broken, that the blame for the suffering to come is just endlessly shifted elsewhere.” It’s this one.

CAMEO CEO Carolina Martinez: The Untapped Power Of Microbusinesses,"Rhett Buttle, Contributor, 
 Rhett Buttle, Contributor
 https://www.forbes.com/sites/rhettbuttle/",Forbes,"As CEO of CAMEO, Carolina Martinez leads a network of more than 400 members in California who support approximately 200,000 micro businesses with assistance and loans.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/rhettbuttle/2024/11/12/cameo-ceo-carolina-martinez-the-untapped-power-of-microbusinesses/,2024-11-12T15:57:27Z," Carolina Martinez, CEO of the CAMEO Network Approximately 99.9% of businesses in the U.S. are small businesses. Of those small businesses, 85% are micro businesses, meaning they are operated by no more than five people and bring in less than $250,000 in revenue a year. These businesses are often started with $50,000 or less in initial capital so they may not have access to traditional commercial loans. Many major banks do not offer business loans under $250,000 so micro businesses rely on microlending for loans and credit. As CEO of the CAMEO Network, Carolina Martinez leads a network of more than 400 members in California who support approximately 200,000 micro businesses with training, business and credit assistance, and loans. Its members include Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs), Small Business Development Centers (SBDCs), Women Business Centers (WBCs), chambers of commerce, and legal service agencies. I recently had the opportunity to speak with Carolina about CAMEO Network’s work and the specific needs of micro businesses. Below is our conversation, edited for clarity. Rhett Buttle: Can you share a bit about your background and what led to the launch of CAMEO Network? Carolina Martinez: CAMEO Network was started by four women who were determined to create and enrich business development programs that serve low-income women entrepreneurs and to break down system barriers to entrepreneurship. Those four organizations have evolved into a 400+ network of business support organizations that make up our entrepreneurial ecosystem of coaching organizations that build the pipeline of loan ready small businesses, mission-driven capital providers (mostly CDFIs), connectors to markets and business networks, and our friends who catalyze small business by promoting entrepreneurship/small business friendly policies. CAMEO Network was born from a desire to build a more inclusive financial system. We realized that helping mission-driven lenders who are providing capital to entrepreneurs in underbanked communities was going to be a powerful way to promote economic opportunity and greater financial inclusion. Our founding coincided with creation of a new program within the U.S. Treasury Department, the national Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) Fund, which was established by President Clinton in 1994 through a bipartisan effort. The creation of the CDFI Fund was a recognition that our financial system needed to do better by small businesses in low- and moderate-income communities. I became interested in entrepreneurship as a career path when I lived in my native Colombia, where I found a job opportunity training former guerrilla combatants at a nonprofit. I saw firsthand how entrepreneurship helped these young people re-enter the economy and create opportunity for themselves. When I moved to the U.S., I carried that passion with me and began working in the small business assistance space. Joining CAMEO Network – an organization with such a strong commitment to and track record of support for the smallest of small businesses – was a natural fit for me. Carolina Martinez: When I joined CAMEO Network in 2018, we were small but mighty. Today, we have greatly expanded our staffing, operating budget, and offerings. We currently represent over 400 organizations, agencies, and individuals – including Small Business Development Centers, CDFIs, and more – that support over 200,000 of California’s smallest businesses through access to capital, coaching, and connections. We also support CDFIs nationwide through our National CDFI Academy, a first-of-a-kind training center providing professional training and resources to thousands of CDFI staff members, launched at the 2022 Clinton Global Initiative and through our Shared Services Center which offers backend support to CDFIs with technology, human resources, and financial services. The pandemic was a huge impetus for our growth. We rapidly scaled our work to help our members to meet the emergency needs of underserved small businesses. Throughout the pandemic and its aftermath, we stepped up our advocacy work on behalf of underserved small businesses, advocating for pandemic small business relief funding, protections from predatory lenders, and expanded for the removal of barriers to entrepreneurship, especially for women- and minority-owned businesses. The pandemic also ushered in a historic small business boom, which brought a renewed urgency to our efforts to build a more equitable economy for small businesses. With so many new businesses starting, we doubled down on our work to ensure every entrepreneur has access to the capital, connections, and coaching they need to grow their business – no matter who they are or what zip code they come from. As part of these efforts, CAMEO Network responded to the needs of the industry with our peer learning and innovative approach for professional development and lending infrastructure building. Our programs have impacted hundreds of microlending and small business lending CDFIs across 49 states and US territories. We’re also continuing full speed ahead on our advocacy efforts to break down barriers to entrepreneurship. Over the last few years, we’ve helped enact a number of landmark policies in California, including the nation’s first lending transparency law to protect small businesses from predatory financing and California’s recent move to legalize street food vendors. We’ve also advocated tirelessly to maintain and increase funding for California’s CDFIs and small business assistance groups. This most recent legislative session, we successfully staved off major proposed cuts to California’s Small Business Development Centers (SBDCs), Women Business Centers (WBCs), and other federally funded programs, despite a serious budget deficit. Carolina Martinez: During the Great Recession, banks significantly pulled back on making the small-dollar, sub-$100,000 loans that small businesses depend on. These types of loans just aren’t very profitable for banks because they cost the same to underwrite as larger loans but yield less interest. In fact, this decline started even earlier. Since 1997, community banks’ share of loans under $100,000 declined from 82% to 29%. It’s important to note that for the very small and underserved businesses that CAMEO Network supports, accessing affordable loans has ALWAYS been a challenge, because of systemic barriers and discrimination. For instance, many immigrants start businesses but do not have credit histories because they are new to the country, so they can’t take out loans or lines of credit. In 2023, Black and Latino business owners were about twice as likely as white business owners to be turned down for funding. Community lenders are different because their whole purpose is to serve the businesses that are being left behind by banks. At its core, micro-business financing is about offering a good product and moving past the aspects of our financial system that perpetuate inequity. As part of this work, CDFIs are very intentional about creating inclusive underwriting systems. For example, many CDFIs have a formula for underwriting that places more emphasis on an applicant’s character compared to their credit score, because CDFIs recognize the inherent ways in which racism and redlining affect credit scores. CDFIs get to know the person behind the business and invest in their dreams. Carolina Martinez: Community lending is here for any small business that can’t get a loan at a traditional bank – which unfortunately, is the majority of small businesses in need of micro-loans. Because of discrimination and the racial wealth gap, businesses that often benefit from micro-business financing include many businesses owned by people of color and immigrants. CDFIs have their doors open to every small business owner, no matter what they look like or where they’re from or who they know. With the small business boom still underway, the need for small business lending is huge, to the point where it’s pushing past the capacity of the community lending system. Three out of four CDFIs saw an increase in demand over the past year, but only 40% reported being able to fully meet the demand. CDFIs are nonprofits and they work on very limited budgets, so they often struggle to scale their lending as quickly as it needs to be scaled. For instance, many have manual underwriting processes. One particularly significant challenge is marketing. Because CDFIs are nonprofits, they are heavily outspent by for-profit online lenders in terms of advertising. This means that any business owner going to Google and searching for a small business loan will most likely be served ads for predatory lenders – the equivalent of payday lenders for small businesses – before they can find out information about CDFIs. In terms of advertising spend and awareness, this is really somewhere where we need parity for CDFIs. We also need a nationwide law, like we have in California, ensuring that small businesses receive full information about how much a loan costs, including the APR and any fees or other costs. Carolina Martinez: With the post-pandemic surge in entrepreneurship still underway and lots of federal money pouring in to support small businesses, scaling community lending – so CDFIs have capacity to meet this demand and get these federal dollars out the door – is a huge part of our strategy. That’s one of the reasons we launched the National CDFI Academy in 2022, which helps CDFIs scale by helping them invest in recruitment and retention, technology, and marketing – so they can compete with fintechs and banks and expand their reach. Since its launch, we’ve helped over 291 unique organizations from 49 states and 2 territories, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, resulting in 538 unique individual participants trained. We’re also a convener. The California Office of the Small Business Advocate partnered with us to manage the 60 partners who are part of California’s State Small Business Credit Initiative project to provide financial technical assistance to our diverse small businesses. We bring them together to share best practices, develop referral relationships and collaborate on ensuring small businesses have access to all the services they need. Policy work is also core to our efforts to expand access to capital. Like I mentioned earlier, we need a nationwide truth-in-lending law ensuring small business owners can fully understand the costs of their loans and be protected from predatory lenders. We are also looking forward to the implementation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s data-collection rule, requiring banks to collect demographic data about who they lend to. This will enable us to measure and address patterns of discrimination in our financial system. Carolina Martinez: Our website, cameonetwork.org, is a great resource for business owners looking to find affordable financing or coaching. We have a list of our members, which includes CDFIs, SBDCs, chambers of commerce, and more, both in California and nationally. Carolina Martinez: If we want to create a brighter future for this country, small businesses have to be at the center of it. When small businesses thrive, we all thrive. They create jobs and prosperity, drive innovation, and build stronger communities. We are in the midst of an incredible moment for small business growth, but we can’t take our foot off the gas. The public, private, and philanthropic sectors all have a continued role to play in sustaining the small business boom and building a more inclusive small business economy for the long-term.

Must the Professor Crusade? W. Ralph Eubanks on the Connection Between Black Writing and Black Resistance,W.

Almost immediately I realized that my thinking was too reactive. Just like eight years ago, when I wrote the journal entries that eventually became the essay below, I did not know what was going to come next. American life and politics don’t exist as scenes from a film that replay in a feedback loop across this country’s diverse landscape. Yet I knew something had changed. The culture wars have certainly heated up since Donald Trump’s rise in 2016, with books being banned across the country, even with a Democrat in the White House. Professors in the humanities like me who teach works of literature that confront issues of race today might even be thought of as “the enemy within.” Similarly, the universities where we teach are seen by some as factories of indoctrination against what is broadly defined as “American ideals.” No, this time things are different. Although the social climate might be different, on the morning after the 2024 election I resolved to teach the ideas about literature that I have always presented in the classroom, just as I did after Donald Trump’s first election. Nothing changes this second time around. In teaching about place, space, and southern literature, I will continue to implore students to see how works by African American writers in the South pursue the question, “How does one move through the world without having one’s existence undermined?” The question remains relevant. While some may think certain works of literature take an activist stance, I will remind them that literature simply holds the power to force us to confront difficult topics and perhaps change the way we look at the world. Books and stories can be a light that leads toward the pursuit of truth in what might be dark times.  –W. Ralph Eubanks, November 2024 _____________________________   This essay originally appeared in Southwest Review. On the morning after the 2016 presidential election, I began to question the long-accepted notion that it is easy to see the beginning of things and harder to see the end. What was actually beginning with the election of Donald Trump, and what was ending? I could not see either of them clearly. Yet as someone who grew up amid the racial turmoil of the civil rights movement, all I could think was, “Good morning America, welcome to Mississippi.” The slight chill in that fall Mississippi morning kept sending me back to images imprinted upon me by a childhood shaped by a closed society and the civil rights past: protests, struggle, and violence. “Here we go again,” I mumbled to myself. Yet these historical flashbacks were not going to help me teach literature in the present. So, I entered my undergraduate seminar on the African American memoir with a steely resolve to keep my students focused. As I ambled down the hall, filled with dread, I could see a cluster of students gathered together in shocked silence in the Eudora Welty Room of the Millsaps College library. Earlier in the semester, as we discussed the concept of otherness, I reminded them of how Zora Neale Hurston famously proclaimed, “I feel most colored when I am thrown against a sharp white background.” If there was ever a time when I understood what Hurston meant, it was the day after Donald Trump’s election. Each time our class met, I asked my students to explore how the books we read revealed the ways the very idea of Blackness collides with American and regional cultural identity. For African Americans, the memoir serves as a means of bearing witness, a way of saying that as a people we are more than what has happened to us. From slave narratives to contemporary writing, memoirs by Black writers ponder what it means to live with difference, particularly a difference placed on a people through this country’s original sin of slavery. Throughout this seminar, I stressed that the silences and gaps Black writers leave in their meditations on race and identity demand just as much attention as those filled spaces in the narrative. Now I was being asked to fill a shocked silence that hung over the classroom. That morning we were finishing our discussion of Jesmyn Ward’s Men We Reaped. In a rushed moment of teaching inspiration, I opened the class with these words from the book’s concluding chapter: “Life is a hurricane, and we board up to save what we can and bow low to the earth to crouch in that small space above the dirt where the wind will not reach.” As we pondered the result of an election that felt like a storm—given the conspicuous psychic damage I saw reflected on my students’ faces—we began to discuss Ward’s grief alongside the sense of loss we felt at that moment. I don’t remember much else about that morning, but I do remember reminding my students of the heavy weight of grief Ward worked through by confronting the most difficult elements of her loss. “Ward did something about her grief so that she did not feel completely powerless and wrenched by the tragedies of those she lost. We all have to do something about what we are feeling right now. I don’t expect any of you to know what you can do. But I think there are signs of how to navigate the future in the lives of the people we have been reading this semester.” Fast forward to Inauguration Day in January 2017. At my home in Washington, DC, my wife and I hosted our son and a group of his friends, who had all traveled from Chicago for the Women’s March. I stayed behind that day to cook for the marchers so they would have a warm dinner waiting for them after a day of walking and protesting in Washington’s winter cold. Since I did not march, my daughter asked me in a tone laced with youthful arrogance, “So what are you going to be doing the next four years to create change in this country?” It didn’t take me long to answer: “I’ll do what I am already doing: teach. Teaching literature is my tool of activism.” I admit I had not thought of my work as a teacher and writer as a tool for social change before my daughter’s question. But her question, combined with my experience with my students on Election Day, made me realize that I needed to begin to teach literature in a different way, to begin to teach beyond the text itself and into how a work of literature from the American past can help us understand the American present and future. When in the fall I began teaching at the University of Mississippi, my alma mater, I started the semester focusing my teaching not only on the nature of narrative but also on how narratives from the literary past help us see the present more clearly. “The South is not just a place of frontier,” the writer and critic Edouard Glissant wrote. “It is also this enclosed place.” As a Mississippi native, I know the boundaries of this space intimately, since it is both my home and the canvas for much of my work as a writer. As a professor at the university known by the loaded moniker “Ole Miss,” I am constantly reminded that I teach in a state and a region that has long distanced itself from the world outside its borders, if only to maintain the languid ardor of a land that has led many to view it as emblematic of the Old South. Activism and Ole Miss seem to be two terms that don’t go together, but since the arrival of James Meredith on this campus in 1962, Black students have carved out a place of social comfort at this university through their activism, whether it was focused on Confederate imagery and statues or about the lack of people of color on the faculty. In the 1970s, when a group of Black students decided to lead a protest during an Up with People concert, they were arrested just minutes after raising their fists in a Black Power salute. In true Faulknerian fashion, the demands the students stood up for during the 1970s have endured and prevailed, in the end making the university a place where a class like mine might be welcomed by the student body. From the start of my teaching at Ole Miss, I wondered if I was wrong about change there. During my first semester, I had only six students sign up for the civil rights and literature class, and only one of them was not Black. The immediate aftermath of the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville served as the backdrop for my first day of classes, so I had current events to juxtapose with the past. A Confederate statue as well as several buildings were also being “contextualized” on campus, leading my students to connect passages from C. Vann Woodward’s The Strange Career of Jim Crow to both the literature we were reading and to Charlottesville. As Woodward notes, the South’s adoption of extreme racism in the 1890s was not so much a conversion as it was “a relaxation of the opposition” to racism. In our small group, we often pondered how much our current moment was the result of a similar easing of opposition and how the texts we were studying held the message that we must never lose sight of how the vestiges of the past exist in our midst. Small classes with a solitary white student remained the pattern for my class until my fourth year at the university, in the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests of the summer of 2020. When I began teaching in August 2020, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, I had thirteen students eager to study Richard Wright, Ralph Ellison, James Baldwin, Ann Petry, Natasha Trethewey, and Claudia Rankine, as well as short stories by Eudora Welty and Lewis Nordan’s reimagining of the Emmett Till murder, Wolf Whistle. What was different was that this time I had only two students of color. On the first day of class, when I asked students to tell me why they took the class, I was not surprised: a majority felt a need to understand this particular cultural moment filled with protests, uprisings, and dissent. As I looked out at the youthful faces gathered in my classroom, I caught a glimpse of the illusion of a post-racial America and South that these students had once been promised. The books we would be studying were connected by the major themes of Black invisibility and erasure, directly in parallel with the news they were encountering every day. The larger question I told them we would be exploring through literature was “How does one move through the world without having one’s existence undermined?” From the very first day, everyone was eager to get started. The title of my Special Topics in English class is “Must the Novelist Crusade? Civil Rights and Activism in Literature.” This class has two foundational texts: Eudora Welty’s essay “Must the Novelist Crusade?” and C. Vann Woodward’s The Strange Career of Jim Crow. While some might think it odd to begin a literature class by delving into a work of American history, in my experience students know little of exactly what life under Jim Crow was like, much less how the system came to be woven into the very fabric of American life. What surprises them all is that Jim Crow had its origins in the North, as well as how Woodward makes it clear that racism “in regimented form” was spread across the whole country in the 1920s, following the initial Great Migration of the South’s children to the North. Welty’s essay serves as a guide to exploring a writer’s social and literary responsibilities. If I were to describe the essay, I would say it is the definitive explanation of how “writing fiction places the novelist and the crusader on opposite sides.” Although Welty’s answer to the question she poses is largely negative, she leaves room for the writer to wrestle with political issues within the realm of human experience. For the purposes of my class, this essay provides a question to explore in each piece of literature we read, from Ellison’s Invisible Man to Rankine’s Citizen: An American Lyric. And while I agree with Welty that the novelist must not crusade, I do use literature to explore historical and political questions the texts bring to light, with an eye toward helping my students recognize the ways literature makes us think about contemporary issues, whether those are the criminal justice system, the Black Lives Matter movement, or our current cultural divide over politics, memory, and monuments. All narrative is inherently political since it derives from a writer’s particular point of view, which is why I position the texts for my class as both literary and political. My unspoken goal for my students is that they leave my class understanding how storytelling holds the power to change the way we look at the world. I could see the impact of the power of storytelling from the very first book we read: Ralph Ellison’s Invisible Man. Ellison’s Invisible Man led one of my students to see how Black invisibility is a surrendering of power, and even to recognize the Battle Royal scene as a metaphor for the way the Civil War’s legacy hangs over African Americans—the men fight “beneath a cloud of blue-gray smoke”—as well as a symbol of how racism takes power from Black Americans. With some prodding, students began to put together the symbolic puzzle Ellison lays out for them on the page and see how the narrator’s continuing series of reversals and mental breakdowns mirrors the cultural narrative of African Americans, a connection they made from reading Woodward. Ann Petry’s The Street launched a discussion of how racism and sexism are intertwined as well as how easily environment can change the course of a person’s life. The theme of surveillance that hangs over the novel reminded them—unprompted—not only of the ways African Americans are under surveillance but of the fact that we all now live in a culture where much of what we do can be tracked or followed. But it was the novel James Baldwin labeled “Everybody’s Protest Novel” that launched the most active discussion of the criminal justice system, the racial geography of American cities, and the value of Black female life. At first, students were repulsed by the lust, fury, and fear inside Richard Wright’s character Bigger Thomas in Native Son. Like Baldwin, they felt that Bigger had been stereotyped into the embodiment of Black as evil, with the robe of the saved in American society available only to those who are white. By the time they finished the novel, they came to see how poverty, fear, and the racial boundaries of Chicago determined the fate of Bigger Thomas. Even the epigraph of Native Son sends a message to the reader that rage and defiance are part of the story. Wright begins with these words from the Book of Job: Even today is my complaint rebellious,
My stroke is heavier than my groaning. Bigger Thomas, like Job in the Old Testament, is under pressure from forces that he can neither understand nor control. Like Job, he rages against them. By framing our initial discussion of Native Son with an exploration of the meaning of the epigraph paired with W.E.B. DuBois’s idea of dual consciousness, I helped my students recognize what I like to think Wright wanted his readers to see: how Bigger Thomas’s duality had damaged him at the very center of his being and had left him fearful and emotionally stunted. And rather than seeing Bigger as simply the embodiment of the young Black thug, several of my students, after understanding the breadth of his story, openly interrogated their own whiteness in the classroom and examined how they were the beneficiaries of the very forces that led Bigger to murder Mary Dalton out of fear. When Bigger is on the run after Mary’s murder, the way Wright describes the racial boundaries of Chicago revealed to my students how even before Bigger commits murder twice—including raping and murdering his girlfriend, Bessie Mears—the intense segregation of the city defines where Bigger can exist but can never be fully human. In Native Son, Wright describes in symbolic and realistic detail how Chicago was divided into Black spaces, white spaces, and a dangerous no-man’s-land for its Black residents. It was the section of the book entitled “Flight” that launched a discussion of how redlining and racism in housing policy continue to cast a long shadow in America well beyond the pages of Wright’s novel. What also affected my students was seeing that while white society convicts Bigger for the rape and murder of Mary Dalton, the court uses the violated Black body of Bessie Mears simply as evidence. “It’s just like the case of Breonna Taylor,” one of my students pointed out, which led to a discussion of the ways Black life is devalued in our society, particularly the lives of Black women. This was one of the rare moments during the semester when all I had to do was facilitate a discussion and make sure it was connected with the text itself. My students did all the work recognizing how both Jim Crow and what I refer to as “Jane Crow” existed, leaving Black women trapped by the forces of race and masculinity. In all of his work, Richard Wright saw a connection between Black writing and Black resistance. Over the course of the past few years, I have come to share that linkage. What I have learned from my activist teaching perspective is that I don’t have to enter the classroom and wear my activism on my sleeve. The professor must not crusade. All I have to do is let a group of great writers do the work. Most important of all, I don’t enter the classroom expecting to change hearts and minds. That is an impossible task. But I do ask everyone who enters the doors of my classroom to think for themselves and recognize the ways the past lives on in the present. Teaching this way has allowed me once again to see clearly the beginning of something, rather than something that feels like a bad ending.

 Call for Papers a service provided by www.english.upenn.edu  Dis/Trusting the Institution(s) of Literature University College Dublin, Ireland 17-20 June 2025 Keynote Speakers –    Prof. Sarah Brouillette (Carleton University)                                  Prof. Christopher Newfield (Independent Social Research Foundation) For at least the last two decades, literary studies has seen a flourishing interest in institutions of various kinds that represent a “middle-zone of cultural space” (English 2005), mediating the relationship of readers to literary texts and to the “institution” of literature itself. This scholarly development, which has adopted many methods from the discipline of sociology, has been characterised as a move away from a “Foucauldian suspicion of institutions” (Rosen 2019), in favour of an orientation that seeks to understand the roles, functions, and values of literary institutions including the creative writing program, the book club, the literary prize, and the publishing house. Against this backdrop, our conference aims to evaluate the current state of the field and to reflect on the cumulative effects of this disciplinary shift concerning institutions. We would like to host a conversation that includes scholars who are producing exciting new work using sociological methods - across subdisciplines and national cultures - alongside scholars interested in reflecting on the broader implications of these methods for literary studies. In order to promote this dual focus, we have chosen to frame our inquiry around the theme of “dis/trust.” While the initial Bourdieusian influence on the field emphasised a neutral or objective orientation towards literary institutions alongside exploring their role in “the production of belief” (Bourdieu 1980, Guillory 1993, Casanova 1999), much subsequent scholarship has professed “an ethos of institutional conservation” (McGurl 2010). More recent critiques have pointed towards reasons to distrust literary institutions, whether from the point of view of political economy, labor conditions, structural inequality, and/or social inclusion (Brouillette 2019, Mulhall 2020, Saha & Van Lente 2022). Quantitative methods have played an important role in this more activist scholarship (Spahr & Young 2015, So 2021, Manshel 2023), while some voices have expressed distrust of the sociological turn itself (n+1 editors 2013, Lahire 2015, Lorentzen 2024). The translation into multiple languages of Gisèle Sapiro’s primer La sociologie de la littérature (2014) demonstrates the international character and cross-pollination of this set of scholarly concerns (Krishnan 2018, Driscoll & Squires 2020, Amlinger 2021). Responding to the call “to establish common ground with scholars doing versions of sociology of literature and publishing studies in varied contexts” (Brouillette 2024), we would like the conference to bring together work being undertaken in Anglophone and non-Anglophone contexts. We also invite participants to think self-reflexively about the academic institutions in which this scholarly turn has taken place, to consider the version of literary studies that has emerged from this turn, and to speculate about “the social demand for our knowledge” (Newfield 2023). Topics for papers might include, but are not limited to, the following:  Abstracts of 200-300 words for 20-minute papers and an author bio of max 100 words should be submitted by e-mail attachment to trust.ucd@gmail.com by 3rd February 2025. We also welcome joint proposals for panels of three papers, or panels with innovative formats. We welcome paper proposals from researchers who are based at institutions around the world, whose research stems from a variety of disciplines and languages, and who are at any career stage. Applicants will be informed by early March as to their inclusion in the conference programme. Please also note that we intend to pursue publication avenues stemming from the conference theme. This conference is co-sponsored by two research projects, “Imaginative Literature and Social Trust, 1990-2025” (www.trustlit.org), funded by the Irish Research Council, and “The Publishing Infrastructures of Contemporary Anglophone Literature,” co-funded by Science Foundation Ireland and the Irish Research Council.

Glyph Lefkowitz: It’s Time For Democrats To Get More Annoying,Glyph Lefkowitz,Glyph.im,"Deciphering Glyph, the blog of Glyph Lefkowitz.",https://blog.glyph.im/2024/11/its-time-for-democrats-to-get-more-annoying.html,2024-11-11T04:01:00Z,"The ground game is everywhere, now. Kamala Harris lost.  Here we are.  So it goes. Are you sad?  Are you scared? I am very sad.  I am very scared. But, like everyone else in this position, most of all, I want to know what to
do next. I believe that we should set up a missionary organization for progressive and
liberal values. In 2017, Kayla Chadwick wrote the now-classic article, “I Don’t Know How To
Explain To You That You Should Care About Other
People”.
It resonated with millions of people, myself included.  It expresses an
exasperation with a populace that seems ignorant of economics, history,
politics, and indeed unable to read the
news.
It is understandable to be frustrated with people who are exercising their
electoral power callously and irresponsibly. But I think in 2024, we need to reckon with the fact that we do, in fact,
need to explain to a large swathe of the population that they should care about
other people. We had better figure out how to explain it soon. The first question that arises when we start considering outreach to the
conservative-leaning or undecided independent population is, “are these people
available to be convinced?”. To that, I must answer an unqualified “yes”. I know that some of you are already objecting. For those of us with an
understanding of history and the mechanics of bigotry in the United States, it
might initially seem like the answer is “no”. As the Nazis came to power in the 1920s, they were campaigning openly on a
platform of antisemitic
violence.
Everyone knew what the debate was. It was hard to claim that you didn’t, in
spite of some breathtakingly cowardly contemporaneous
journalism, they
weren’t fooling anyone. It feels ridiculous to say this, but Hitler did not have support among Jews. Yet, after campaigning on a platform of defaming immigrants, and Mexican
immigrants
specifically
for a decade, a large part of what drove his victory is that Trump enjoyed a
shockingly huge surge of support among the Hispanic
population.
Even some undocumented
migrants
— the ones most likely to be herded into concentration camps starting in
January — are supporting him. I believe that this is possible because, in order to maintain support of the
multi-ethnic working-class
coalition
that Trump has built, the Republicans must maintain plausible deniability.
They have to say “we are not racist”, “we are not xenophobic”.  Incredibly,
his supporters even say “I don’t hate trans
people”
with startling regularity. Most voters must continue to believe that hateful policies with devastating
impacts
are actually race-neutral, and are simply going to get rid of “bad” people.
Even the ones motivated by racial resentment are mostly motivated by factually
incorrect
beliefs
about racialized minorities receiving special treatment and resources which
they are not in fact receiving. They are victims of a disinformation machine. One that has rendered reality
incomprehensible. If you listen to conservative messaging, you can hear them referencing this all
the time.  Remember when JD
Vance
made that comment about Democrats calling Diet Mountain Dew racist? Many publications wrote about this joke “bombing”1, but the kernel of truth
within it is this: understanding structural bigotry in the United States is
difficult.  When we progressives talk about it, people who don’t understand
it think that our explanations sound ridiculous and incoherent. There’s a reason that the real version of critical race
theory is a graduate-level
philosophy-of-law course, and not a couple of catch phrases. If, without context, someone says that “municipal zoning
laws are racist”, this
makes about as much sense as “Diet Mountain Dew is racist” to someone who
doesn’t already know what
“redlining” is. Conservatives prey upon this
confusion to their
benefit.  But they prey on this because they must do so. They must do so
because, despite everything, hate is not actually popular among the American
electorate.  Even now, they have to be deceived into it. The good news is that all we need to do is stop the deception. If I have sold you on the idea that a substantial plurality of voters are
available to be persuaded, the next question is: can we persuade them?  Do
we, as progressives, have the resources and means to do so?  We did lose, after
all, and it might seem like nothing we did had much of an impact. Let’s analyze that assumption. Across the country, Trump’s margins increased.  However, in the swing states,
where Harris spent money on campaigning, his margins increased less than
elsewhere.  At time of writing, we
project
that the safe-state margin shift will be 3.55% towards trump, and the
swing-state margin shift will be 1.69%. This margin was, sadly, too small for a victory, but it does show that the
work mattered.  Perhaps given more time, or more resources, it would have
mattered just a little bit more, and that would have been decisive. This is to say, in the places where campaign dollars were spent, even against
the similar spending of the Trump campaign, we pushed the margin of support
1.86% higher within 107 days.  So yes: campaigning matters.  Which parts and
how much are not straightforward, but it definitely matters. This is a bit of a nonsensical comparison for a whole host of reasons2, but
just for a ballpark figure, if we kept this pressure up continuously during
the next 4 years, we could increase support for a democratic candidate by 25%. Political junkies tend to overestimate the knowledge of the average voter.
Even when we are trying to compensate for
it, we
tend to vastly overestimate how much the average voter knows about politics
and policy.  I suspect that you, dear reader, are a political junkie even if
you don’t think of yourself as one. To give you a sense of what I mean, across the country, on Election day and
the day after, there was a huge spike in interest for the Google query, “did
Joe Biden drop
out”. Consistently
over
the last
decade,
democratic policies are more popular than their
opponents.
Even deep red states, such as Kansas, often vote for policies supported by
democrats and opposed by
Republicans. This confusion about policy is not organic; it is not voters’ fault. It is
because Republicans constantly
lie. All this ignorance might seem discouraging, but it presents an opportunity:
people will not sign up to be persuaded, but people do like being informed.
Rather than proselytizing via a hard sales pitch, it should be possible to
offer to explain how policy connects to elections.  And this is made so much
the easier if so many of these folks already generally like our policies. I’ve listed some reasons for optimism, but that does not mean that this will be
easy. Republicans have a tremendously powerful, decentralized media
apparatus that
reinforces their culture-war messaging all the time. After some of the post-election analysis, “The Left Needs Its Own Joe
Rogan”
is on track to become a cliché within the week.3 While I am deeply
sympathetic to that argument, the right-wing media’s success is not organic; it
is funded by petrochemical
billionaires. We cannot compete via billionaire financing, and as such, we have to have a way
to introduce voters to progressive and liberal media.  Which means more
voters need social connections to liberals and progressives. The democratic presidential campaign alone spent a billion and a half
dollars.
And, as shown above, this can be persuasive, but it’s just the persuasion
itself. Better than spending all this money on telling people what good stuff we
would do for them if we were in power, we could just show them, by doing
good stuff.  We should live our values, not just endlessly reiterate them. A billion dollars is a significant amount of power in its own right. For historical precedent, consider the Black Panthers’ Free Breakfast For
Children program.
This program absolutely scared the shit out of the conservative power
structure, to the point that Nixon’s FBI literally raided them for giving out
free food to children. Religious missionaries, who are famously annoying, often offset their
annoying-ness by doing charitable work in the communities they are trying to
reach.  A lot of the country that we need to reach are religious people, and
nominally both Christians and leftists share a concern for helping those in
need, so we should find some cultural common ground there. We can leverage that overlap in values by partnering with churches.  This
immediately makes such work culturally legible to many who we most need to
reach. When I raised this idea with Philip James,
he had been mulling over similar ideas for a long time, but with a slightly
different tack: free career skills workshops from folks who are obviously
“non-traditional” with respect to the average rural voter’s cultural
expectations.  Recruit trans folks, black folks, women, and non-white
immigrants from our tech networks. Run the trainings over remote video conferencing to make volunteering more
accessible.  Run those workshops through churches as a distribution network. There is good evidence that this sort of prolonged contact and direct exposure
to outgroups, to help people see others as human beings, very
effective politically. However, job skills training is by no means the only benefit we could bring.
There are lots of other services we could offer remotely, particularly with the
skills that we in the tech community could offer.  I offer this as an initial
suggestion; if you have more ideas I’d love to hear them.  I think the best
ideas are ones where folks can opt in, things that feel like bettering oneself
rather than receiving charity; nobody likes getting handouts, particularly
from the outgroup, but getting help to improve your own skills feels more
participatory. I do think that free breakfast for children, specifically, might be something
to start with because people are far more willing to accept gifts to benefit
others (particularly their children, or the elderly!) rather than themselves. Doing good works in the community isn’t enough.  We need to do visible good
works.  Attributable good works. We don’t want to be assholes about
it, but we do want to make sure that
these benefits are clearly labeled.  We do not want to attach an obligation to
any charitable project, but we do want to attach something to indicate where it
came from. I don’t know what that “something” should be.  The most important thing is that
whatever “something” is appeals to set of partially-overlapping cultures that I
am not really a part of — Midwestern, rural, southern, exurban, working class,
“red state” — and thus, I would want to hear from people from those cultures
about what works best. But it’s got to be something. Maybe it’s a little sticker, “brought to you by progressives and liberals. we
care about you!”.  Maybe it’s a subtle piece of consistent branding or graphic
design, like a stylized blue stripe.  Maybe we need to avoid the word
“democrats”, or even “progressive” or “liberal”, and need some independent
brand for such a thing, that is clearly tenuously connected but not directly;
like the Coalition of Liberal and Leftist Helpful Neighbors or something. Famously, when Trump sent everybody a check from the government, he put his
name on it.  Joe Biden did the same thing, and Democrats seem to think it’s a
good thing that he didn’t take credit because it “wasn’t about advancing
politics”,
even though this obviously backfired.  Republicans constantly take credit for
the benefits of Democratic
policies,
which is one reason why voters don’t know they’re democratic policies. Our broad left-liberal coalition is attempting to improve people’s material
conditions.  Part of that is, and must be, advancing a political agenda.
It’s no good if we provide job trainings and free lunches to a community if
that community is just going to be reduced to ruin by economically catastrophic
tariffs and mass deportations. We cannot do this work just for the credit, but getting credit is important. I think this is a good idea, but I am not the right person to lead it. For one thing, building this type of organization requires a lot of
organizational and leadership skills that are not really my forte.  Even the
idea of filing the paperwork for a new 501(c)3 right now sounds like rolling
Sisyphus’s rock up the hill to me. For another, we need folks who are connected to this culture, in ways that I
am not.  I would be happy to be involved — I do have some relevant technical
skills to help with infrastructure, and I could always participate in some of
the job-training stuff, and I can definitely donate a bit of money to a
nonprofit, but I don’t think I can be in charge. You can definitely help too, and we will need a wide variety of skills to
begin with, and it will definitely need money.  Maybe you can help me figure
out who should be in charge. This project will be weaker without your support.  Thus: I need to hear from
you. You can email me, or, if you’d prefer a more
secure channel, feel free to reach out over
Signal,
where my introduction code is glyph.99 .  Please start the message with “good
works:” so I can easily identify conversations about this. If I receive any interest at all, I plan to organize some form of meeting
within the next 30 days to figure out concrete next steps. Thank you to my patrons who are supporting my writing on
this blog.  If you like what you’ve read here and you’d like to read more
things like it, or you’d like to support my various open-source
endeavors, you can support my work as a
sponsor!  My aspirations for this support are more in the
directions of software development than activism, but needs must, when the
devil drives.
Thanks especially to Philip James for both
refining the idea and helping to edit this post, and to Marley
Myrianthopoulos for assistance with
the data analysis. Personally I think that the perception of it “bombing” had to do with the
microphones during his speech not picking up much in the way of crowd
noise.  It sounded to me like there were plenty of claps and laughs at the
time.  But even if it didn’t land with most of the audience, it
definitely resonated for some of them. ↩ A brief, non-exhaustive list of the most obvious ones: ↩ I mostly agree with this take, and in the interest of being the change I
want to see in the world, let me just share a brief list of some
progressive and liberal sources of media that you might want to have a look
at and start paying attention to: Please note that not all of these are to my taste and not all of them may be to yours.  They are all at different places along the left-liberal coalition spectrum, but find some sources that you enjoy and trust, and build from there. ↩"

Why Did Latinos Vote for Trump?,Xochitl Gonzalez,The Atlantic,The narrative of America as the land of the free has ceased to be many voters’ top priority.,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/11/latinos-vote-trump/680596/,2024-11-09T12:31:00Z,"The narrative of America as the land of the free has ceased to be many voters’ top priority. Produced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (NOA) using AI narration. Donald Trump called Latino migrants rapists, murderers, and drug dealers. After one of his final rallies, at which a comedian described Puerto Rico as “a floating island of garbage,” many people, myself included, thought Latinos would decisively turn against him. We were wrong. Exit polls show that 46 percent of Latinos voted for him, and among Latino men, he won 55 percent of the votes—a huge increase from 36 percent in 2020. Many Americans are baffled. How could Latinos—many of whose family members could be targeted by the mass deportations that the Trump team is promising—make this choice? But seeing the results—and hearing from Latino Trump voters—it made perfect sense to me. This was, simply, a vote for capitalism. American values are especially powerful in groups with large immigrant populations; those values are what draw people here. Though many of America’s earliest immigrants came here seeking relief from famine and poverty, our freedoms—to worship freely, to speak freely—are what we became famous for. The promise was mythologized on the Statue of Liberty: our welcome to the tired, poor, huddled masses, who yearned not to grow filthy rich, but to be free. In the 20th century, immigrants fled religious persecution and political oppression to find in America freedoms that they, and their descendants, cherished and took seriously. I was raised by my grandfather, a Puerto Rican veteran of World War II. We didn’t have a lot of money, but I was taught that our political freedoms and our moral obligation to democracy mattered more. At the same time, from the very beginning, the land of the free has also been about the freedom to make and spend money. America put God on our money, but for many Americans, money is God. This nation put profit over morality through centuries of slavery. Individual expediency in the name of capitalism is as American as the right to bear arms. Around the world, no idea has been marketed more effectively than the American dream. America: where even corporations can be people! And when we talk about someone living “the American dream,” we aren’t referring to their trips to the voting booth or the way they utilize their freedom of assembly. We are praising people who have achieved financial success and accumulated material things. Read: Why Democrats are losing Hispanic voters We deify and elevate these people in the media, in social settings, and online, and we rarely question the ethical price that may have been paid to get them there. Just look at Trump, the “self-made man” whose father’s real-estate fortune launched his career. Until Trump became a political villain, he was an American success story. He was regularly on Oprah and sung about in hip-hop songs, and he had that cameo in Home Alone 2. And the truth is, for many Americans—Latinos included—he still is that man. He is living the dream; he has buildings with his name on them. Latinos broke for Trump for many complicated reasons, including sexism, religious conservatism, racism (or a desire to assimilate into whiteness). But the simplest answer is often the best: To many, Trump represents prosperity. And the ability to financially prosper is what America is all about. People believe this, because America told them so. In polls, Latinos consistently put economic issues at the top of their list of concerns. After the election, the media was full of voters reaffirming this. As one Pennsylvania voter of Puerto Rican descent told NBC News, he wasn’t bothered by Trump’s comments about the island: “For me, it’s work. It’s the economy. It’s groceries.” Why, one might ask, was this narrative so much more persuasive to Latinos than to Black Americans? Perhaps because the American dream wasn’t created with Black people in mind. The civil-rights movement was painstakingly built by exploiting America’s political rights to assembly and free speech. When Black Americans in the North couldn’t buy homes because of redlining, many could still—despite obstacles—vote. Perhaps Black voters understood better than many Latino voters an essential truth: Access to the American dream is elusive, but America’s freedoms are indispensable. One of the great takeaways of this election is that the narrative of America as the land of the free has ceased to be many voters’ top priority. This election was a battle for the soul of the nation—but the fight wasn’t between American ideals and un-American ones. It was between our best and worst selves. More Stories What Can Women Do Now?
